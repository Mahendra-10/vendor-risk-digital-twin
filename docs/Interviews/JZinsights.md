This interview is packed with validation for your VRDT idea. Here are specific, quotable insights, grouped so you can drop them into slides, reports, or your script. (You’ll want to paraphrase slightly in final academic work rather than copy verbatim.)

1. How CGI currently does vendor risk
Key insight: Vendor vetting today is manual, legal-heavy, and slow; they already use “almost a digital twin.”

On foreign / third‑party software vetting:

“We carefully vet any software or any supplier… we had to do the trade compliance, make sure they weren’t on any terrorist watch list or embargo list… Once the legal stuff was checked, we actually got the code and then we put it in a sandbox… we watched every single packet, analyzed it and ensured that it was just doing what it was supposed to do, nothing more.”

On using sandbox environments:

“Anytime we’re bringing anything into our ecosystem… we thoroughly test it in a sandbox. Almost a digital twin of the real world environment… just to make sure nothing sneaky is going to happen and nothing bad happens, you know, like the CrowdStrike thing.”

On legal / contract work being manual:

“Especially on the contract, the legality side, the trade compliance, the contracts, procurements, that’s a lot of manual work and sometimes they get tricked.”

Use these to motivate: “Today, even sophisticated federal contractors do all this manually, case‑by‑case, with ad‑hoc ‘digital twin–like’ sandboxes.”

2. Problems and gaps in current vendor risk
Key insight: Data quality, rebranding, stale info, and over‑reliance on self‑reported proof are major pain points.

On data and identity / company mapping:

“There’s really just the info mapping. Information is really hard… having good data, not stale data and reliable data… it’s only as good as the information that’s in there.”

On company rebranding / evasion:

“Say a company does something bad, so they rebrand. Now you don’t know this company name is associated with this new company name… trickery can be a problem.”

On trusting documents and proof:

“Being able to trust the information that somebody gives us… there’s implicit trust. I have to trust them and trust the proof that they’re handing me. Having a way to find impartial outside sources to validate information… is really helpful.”

These support your “data freshness + independent risk intelligence” angle.

3. Confirmation that your VRDT idea is valuable
Key insight: He explicitly says your idea aligns with his PhD work, is needed, and is part of “Industry 5.0.”

Direct endorsement of your idea:

“Yeah, that’s great… What you’re proposing is similar to what I’m proposing: make a digital twin of the real world system… and you mess with it.”

On critical infrastructure and patch risk:

“Whenever you push a patch, you’re taking a risk of breaking something operationally. But if you don’t take that risk, you’re leaving a vulnerability open… So it’s constantly a balancing act.”

On why simulate first:

“Being able to do what you’re suggesting—simulate, ‘Okay, I’m going to do this thing or this service breaks’… in a real world only, that’s risky… So being able to test that out in a digital twin is huge.”

On Industry 5.0 framing:

“What you’re suggesting is called Industry 5.0… an AI‑driven model and simulation… This is a very important project you guys are working on, very interesting to the community.”

Great quotes for “Why this research matters / academic relevance” slides.

4. Your integration / “build on top of GRC tools” strategy
Key insight: He likes your “layer on top of existing tools” concept but says you must prove integration with concrete use cases.

On integrating with existing tools:

“So if you’re able to expand that to not just the environment… but also the database we’ve built, the various containers and microservices… that would be very useful.”

On GRC evidence & dashboards:

“Wouldn’t it be great if Google had a dashboard that had all of the NIST controls and you just have it spit out a screenshot or a table… proving that you’re meeting that requirement across the board? That would really make GRC much, much easier.”

On your “built on top” approach:

“It’s a great idea. You’d have to prove it, though. So you’d have to have several use cases… and be able to give a custom example to a client… ‘Here’s how our product would integrate all those things.’”

These are perfect to back your “we’re not replacing Archer / ServiceNow / SCC; we’re augmenting them” slide.

5. Simulation for business decisions (multi‑cloud, outages, supply chain)
Key insight: He gives you ready‑made scenarios you can turn into demo stories.

On multi‑cloud and cost–benefit:

“Do we lose more money in a three‑day outage than it would cost for two years of having two clouds doing the exact same thing? They can actually do a real cost‑benefit analysis and see the impact.”

On AWS outage–style events:

“AWS broke… Is it worth the money to go multi‑cloud…? Your system can actually help simulate that.”

On supply chain attacks:

“This system can really help in a supply chain type of attack where the company might not be attacked itself, but a third party further down the chain gets attacked and now you have the ripple effect.”

These are gold for your “example simulations” slide (Stripe down, AWS region failure, compromised vendor, etc.).

6. Digital twin + AI risk and fidelity (for your “Risks & Assumptions” slide)
Key insight: You must consider fidelity and “human in the loop” for AI‑driven recommendations.

On fidelity of the twin:

“One of the risks is when you abstract to a digital twin, you can get bare functionality, but not necessarily all functionality… you have to be really, really precise.”

On AI as decision aid vs decision maker:

“Use it as a decision aid, but not as a decision tool… It can speed up your observe–orient–decide–act loop, but the human makes the decision.”

You can cite this when you talk about “VRDT as decision support, not auto‑pilot.”
