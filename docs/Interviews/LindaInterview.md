[00:00] Speaker A: Oops.
[00:01] Speaker B: Oh, I think I got it. Yeah. Okay, cool. I guess the first thing, just to start off with a
little bit of background. Linda, could you tell us a little bit about your background and sort of what made
you work in the GRC space?
[00:16] Speaker A: Well, I was in the Army. I joined the army in 1977. Well, before y' all even thought
about it was a long time ago. And my first job was artillery repair. But when my three years came up
and it was time for me to reenlist, I had to figure out what did I want to do. So I joined. So I reenlisted
and I went into the computer field. And so I came in the computer field when it was like big mainframes,
like a whole room had one little bitty computer in it. Well, I had big computer, but, you know, the.
Probably the processing speed of the computer that was in that room, probably the phones that we use
today are, you know, will exceed whatever they did. And so I just saw an evolution of the computers
and everything. So once I retired, I became a contractor for the government. I went into training at first,
and from training, they moved me into security. And I had. I managed about 45 different military units
that had software that had to be authorized and had to go through the ATO process in order to be on
the army network. So going through these documents and trying to determine, you know, their software
list, their security controls, all those things that they needed in order to have their software on the
network, it opened my eyes to a lot of things on the security side. So I left one contract and went into
another contract, which actually is the contract that I'm on now with CGI Federal. They bought our
company out. So I've been with CGI Federal for about 17 years now. And yes, so with. With that, I still
worked on the ATO program with. With the 853. And then I was moved over to CMMC, which only has
110 controls. And I don't know how much you know about the cmmc. It's the Cyber Security Maturity
model certification for the government. Right now, it's only for dod, and they were trying to enhance the
protection of army networks. So that's where that governance, risk and compliance came in. Making
sure that we were complying with the regulations that we were required to comply with, making sure
that we did risk assessments. Anytime a new control or a new software or anything was introduced,
then we had to, you know, do a risk assessment on those and just, you know, compliance. So that GRC
is the whole package making sure. That security becomes first. The only thing is it's really hard when
you're working with engineers, engineers and programmers and developers, they want to just get their
product out and they're not really concerned about the security issues. And especially with Agile. Agile
is, you know, these two week sprints getting it, everything, get everything done right now. Right now,
right now. But they don't take the time to stop and incorporate security into those factors. So we're not
the best, we don't make the best friends. You know, they really don't like seeing us coming because
they sometimes have to stop and then have to reconsider the code that they wrote and incorporate into
those security controls. And so, so that's really about my background. It's about, you know, where,
where I came from and how I got into this field and how I'm still working in this field.
[04:02] Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, I guess not getting too specific at all, but could you just tell us a
little bit about what a sort of like typical workday would look like for you? Kind of on a high level?
[04:14] Speaker A: Well, mostly in, mostly what I'm working with. Mahendra, is that you?
[04:21] Speaker C: Yeah, that's me.
[04:22] Speaker A: Oh, that's you. Okay. Okay. Yes. I think that's the first time I might have seen your
face. So working with Mahindra right now we're, without really giving a whole lot of detail, our typical
day is controls, the security controls. So with 853nist, 853, there's really, there's not, there's. There
might be like 300 controls, but the whole, the whole part of it is, what we're working on now is they have
breaking these controls down to if, if a control, let's say for configuration management, has 67 controls.
And out of those controls you might have one that's like CM14, but CM14 might have a, B, C, D, E. And
then that counts into five different separate controls. So it leads up to a lot. So, and the reason they
broke this down, just so you guys know, is sometimes when people look at a control, they look at the
baseline and they say, okay, we already have this. But the only thing is they may not have. They may
have addressed A, B and E, but they didn't do anything with C and D. So then they have to go back and
look at it again and say, oh, wait a minute, you addressed this, this and this, but you didn't take care of
this. So that's why when you're working in some organizations, they'll break it out to the smallest level
to make sure that nothing gets missed. So when an assessor comes into your organization and the first
thing they're going to do is they're going to look at your ssp, the system security plan. And the system
security plan is going to list out all of the, all of the system, it's going to list out all of the hardware, all of
the software, it's going to list out where it's located, it's going to give a list of all of the administrators and
who has rights to what. And then after it lists all of the system requirements, then it'll go into all of the
security controls and each security control has to be broke down and the assessor is going to look and
see, did you address ABCD and enf? So if you didn't, then they're going to say, well, you know, what
about this right here? And then in the process of looking at these controls is where the evidence comes
in. So when assessor comes in to look at the organization, they not only want to see this piece of paper
that says we do this, this and this and this, they want proof. So you have to go into that control and if
it's, let's say, let's say it's a screen saver, so a screensaver should turn on in 15 minutes of inactivity. So
you might be at your desk, you might be working. But if you sit back and you're reading something,
even if it's something you printed out or something else, then in 15 minutes your screen should lock up
and they're going to look and see first of all, did that do it? So they might wait, they might have
somebody screen beside them and without any activity in 15 minutes they'll see that it locks up. But
then they also want to look at the network settings to see that the network administrator set that
particular control that, you know, they'll look at that control and they'll say, oh yeah, it's set for 15
minutes. So that's another piece of evidence. So everything, any kind of evidence that you can provide
to prove that you not only screenshots, but settings and even documentation to prove that you are, that
you have implemented that control the way it's supposed to be implemented. And that's what causes a
good evaluation. So if you have good assessment, for instance, we just did a CMMC assessment three
years ago and we had all 110 controls in place. But the thing that it was, we had 1850 plus pieces of
evidence. Wow, Screenshots, everything, you know, screenshots, the Documentation. So like system
security plans, the asset control plan community, the configuration management plan, contingency plan
and then procedures, you know, so in one of our contracts we don't have to worry about the
procedures, the government's handling that. But we had to develop and write procedures. I mean the
policies, we didn't have to do the policies, but we had to do the procedures. But some organizations,
you might have to do both, you might have to develop both of them. And those also, those documents
also become evidence and artifacts. So there's a lot.
[08:47] Speaker B: Quick clarifying question then is sort of all this like evidence gathering, like you
know, making sure all the controls are right, screenshotting. This is what you would consider like a
cloud compliance audit or is that.
[08:59] Speaker A: Oh yeah, yeah. The cloud, it doesn't matter if it's on prem or cloud it they, you still
have to identify, you still have to go through every control and you still have address how the cloud. And
now see some of it might be some of your cloud lists like Azure or AWS or Google. If they're going to be
your cloud supporter, then they are responsible for certain controls. So they're called inherited controls.
Which means they have to provide the proof. If they're your, what is it? Service provider. You know, if
they're your cloud service provider then they have to provide their evidence, they have to provide their
ssp, they have to provide copies of their evidence of their screenshots of their settings to prove that
they are maintaining what they told you they're going to maintain. So you have inherited controls, then
you have partially inherited controls where the cloud service provider might have partial and then the
customer is responsible for partial. So the cloud service provider, they might be able to fill a part of it,
but then you have to come in and do your part too. So you'd have to have evidence from both the cloud
service provider and from the client. I mean from the customer.
[10:22] Speaker B: I see. Then from your experience working on this as well as working with people
who are doing this evidence gathering, could you talk a little bit about like what you have found is like
the most time consuming or like resource like intensive tasks within this whole, you know, huge
process.
[10:40] Speaker A: Yeah. So the hardest part is to write an implementation statement. An
implementation statement tells the assessor how you're, how you're doing it, what you're doing or who's
doing it and how they're doing it. That's the implementation statement. That's really the hardest part
because if you have, if you have an established system already, it doesn't take that long because you
already know who to reach out to. You know the network folks to reach out to, you know the developers
to reach out to, you know the security folks to reach out to to get that evidence. But when you're in the
middle of developing a new system and some things haven't even been developed yet, then it makes it
harder for you to find the evidence that you're requesting. And then it also makes it harder to determine
who needs to provide that evidence. And in that evidence gathering, you should keep a track of the
team that you're reaching out to, like your network security team or your SOC if you're reaching out to
the SOC for information, because they're the ones that are going to have to harden your firewalls and
stuff, so they have to provide information and evidence for that. So you should keep track of your teams
and who's on that team and who provided that evidence. Because when you get ready to have your
assessment, the assessor is going to ask you those questions. And it's so much easier to have that
person that knows that information, that knows how to get it to come on online and speak on that part,
because for a couple of reasons, they can bring up the screenshot, they can bring up the settings, you
know, they can bring up the network settings and show how things are set and they can talk on that
because that what they do. So everybody plays a part in it. You're not going to have just one person.
The, the, the ISO, the Information System Security Officer is not going to be the only person that's
going to be able to talk during an audit because they, they don't have access. I don't have access to
network settings. So I would need that person to go in, show that screenshot, open that setting up,
show that it said for 15 minutes for your screensaver. So it just takes a lot of coordination. It takes a lot
of coordination to who's going to give you the information and then, and then gathering that information.
And we have folder, yeah, folders set up for each control. So for the AC control, for access control, you
have all the evidence put into there. And then for your continuation planning, you have some evidence
in there for your information, assurance for everything that you have to have a control on and a piece of
evidence for. You have to have it organized because you can't just randomly say, oh my gosh, let's,
let's see if so and so is online and see if they can pull it up. You have to be organized with that, with
gathering the evidence that's the hardest part really gathering the evidence and identifying who's going
to provide that evidence so that they can be in that assessment.
[13:35] Speaker B: Yeah, I see. So you kind of mentioned a little bit about that organization aspect. So
as someone as doesn't have much experience in this DRC space, how is it that you guys currently sort
of store and organize the evidence so that like it's audit ready, like you get all the information. How do
you go from information to. Right.
[13:54] Speaker A: We have a couple of, we have a couple of tools that we use. One, we use
SharePoint and SharePoint is the, is the tool that we can have documents out there and then whoever
needs to access that document. So from hand draw my give him access to a specific document, I want
him to look at that document and review it and then he can make his updates and comments. But the
good part about SharePoint is we have autosave on so that if he's making a change within a couple of
seconds, the change is automatically updated. But the nice part about that too is he can open that
document, I can open that document, a third person can, and all three of us can be working in it at the
same time making updates and changes without interfering with the other one so that you don't have a
document that you're working on. And then I send it to Mahindra, he works on it and then he sends to
somebody else. Now somebody else has a third copy and, and I'm still working on something, then I'm
going to have to get the information from them. So that SharePoint tool allows us to collaborate in that
same document at the same time. So that's, that's one good tool. And the second tool is right now we're
using ado, which is Azure Development, something I can't remember what the acronym is and what
that tool does is that's, that's. We're using that for one of our contracts in order to track tickets. It's, it's
like a ticket ticket repository. So if I need to reach out to a different to, to the SoC and I need evidence, I
can have them create a ticket. That ticket will be assigned to them. They'll open the ticket, they'll look at
it, they'll review it, they'll provide the evidence. There's a link in there that they can add an ATT
attachment, they can link it to another ticket if they want to, they can reassign it to somebody else. So
we may have sent it to the team lead, but the team lead is going to farm it out now down to the, to the
worker bees and assign that ticket out. Then that person will get a notification and they'll be responsible
to have that ticket closed out. And then we have like updated meetings. We go through Agile and we
have two week sprints. And every two weeks, well really every day we go in, they look at our tickets,
they say, okay, how are you doing on this, this, this, what's your status? Where are you working on it?
Can we close it? And then at the end of the two weeks, you want to close that ticket and move on to the
next sprint. So there's different ways of working. Not everybody works in Agile. But this, that's just a
really good tool. So it's the ADO Azure development. DevOps. Azure. DevOps, that's what it's called.
And it's a ticket, like I said, it's a ticketing repository. So you can go online and look up Azure DevOps
and look and see what it does. And we're actually using it for two different systems. We're using it for a
project we're working on now. And then plus we have for the cmmc, we're getting ready to recertify in
April. So we're going back through that ticketing process, look at our tickets, look at our evidence. And
in those systems, when you're doing assessments, your evidence has to be only one year old. So if you
gather that screenshot two years ago, you're going to have to go back to that person and say, I need an
updated screenshot. Because something may have changed. You know, the software may have
updated a version, may have updated a patch may have been applied. So whatever might have
changed in that one year time frame, it has to be within that year. And that's when assessors look at it,
if it's older than a year, they won't even accept that piece of evidence.
[17:28] Speaker B: I see. So talk a little bit about how before, in terms like this, the coordination
challenges, like when you don't have like an established system, obviously there's a lot of time that
takes in terms of like screenshotting or just like having to communicate with different teams. So then in
general, like, how would you say these sort of challenges, when they arise, affect the, like the audit
timeline. Right? Because obviously you guys also have a day where you guys got to get things done,
have to keep it moving. So like in general, like when, when challenges come up, how does it affect the
timeline? How does it like slow the process.
[17:56] Speaker A: Down or it, it does affect it and it. So, so if if you've got a team, you've. Let's say
you've got. Well, let's say you got seven teams, and each team has a part of something that they're
doing in order for this, this process to work. So somebody might be working on audits, somebody might
be working on development, somebody might be working on setting up, like, dashboards, and
somebody might be setting up something else. And then you've got your security team that are working
on security controls. So you've got everybody, that everybody. And when you have to stop what you're
doing and you have to reach out to another team and ask them for help and they're busy, it kind of
slows the process down if they don't give you the information, because now I can't get my job done
because you're not giving me the information. And I don't know this job. I don't know what you're doing.
You have to tell me what you're doing. You have to provide the information to me because you're the
one that's setting this up. So it does get frustrated. I mean, it's frustrating when you're trying to complete
your task, but you're dependent on somebody else or another team. So it does, it does get very
frustrating. And it can push the timeline back. But that's where you have managers and leaders and
government saying, I need this right now. So you need to go back and tell them I said give it to you. It
depends on who says what. Will, you know, sometimes get a little bit of action, you know, get you the
information. But it's really, it is frustrating when you have to. When you're having to depend on
somebody else to provide the information to complete your job.
[19:37] Speaker B: So that makes sense. So then kind of along those lines, if there was, if you could
improve or even like automate parts of the sort of this whole evidence collection process, what would
you, what features or capabilities would you want to prioritize, like, from your, you know, many years of
experience?
[19:54] Speaker A: Well, there are, there are applications out there that we're in the process right now
as a company are reviewing that will help automate these particular controls. So, but it's still, it's still a
matter of input. So it doesn't matter if I get a good tool, but I don't have the people inputting the right
information. What good is that tool? So, but there are, there are, there are automated ways, and I know
there's some tools we're in the process of reviewing some. I just can't Call them off the top of my head.
And what they are, is their ways of going in. All the controls are already there. So for us, we've had to
build things. We had to build spreadsheets and put all the controls in there and then decide how we're
going to do this, this and this. So it a little bit time consuming. Some of these automated programs have
all of that in there for you. So that saves time. But you still have to input the information, you still have to
input the evidence, you still have to input the documentation. So you still have to input in. In information
in it. And I know you guys were looking at AI and AI is kind of still. Even though it's been out for a while,
it's still fairly new and it's still fairly dangerous. There's still a lot of risks involved in AI because just like
anything, if the old adage where, you know, oh, I found it on the Internet, if it's on the Internet, it's got to
be true. We already know that's not the case. You know, it's not always the case that what you find on
the Internet could be true. So you have to be careful even using AI products by pulling in the
information. Where is it pulling it from? And then there we have companies that strictly refuse to allow
you to use AI. They strictly refuse to you using client information in, in AI. So I think it's becoming better.
I think they're, I think they're, you know, developing some of the security aspects of AI. And as soon as
that, as soon as that comes into play, as soon as they have an AI product and we use some things like
Mahendra, you know what Dito with the one.
[22:18] Speaker B: This.
[22:18] Speaker C: Is a CGI assist.
[22:19] Speaker A: CGI assist. But there's another one too.
[22:21] Speaker C: Oh, it's with the Microsoft one. Yeah, yeah, it's called, it's called. Yeah, it's the
Microsoft version of their own.
[22:28] Speaker A: But you know what I'm talking about.
[22:29] Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of restrictions though. Yeah, it has a lot of.
[22:32] Speaker A: Yeah, but there's restrict. Yeah, it's very, very restricted. Yeah. So, you know, it's.
If, I mean, they are working on getting things automated, but it's still, again, it's still a matter of input.
You know, you still have to input your evidence, you still have to do your, your documentation for your
procedures and your plans and your SOPs and those kind of things. So. And policies. So it's still. Even
though they have a head start for it and you can write up, I mean, I think it would be good if they had a
really, really good AI program that, that was very effective and that you could put. Give me an
implementation statement for. But the only thing is with those implementation statements is it's always
going to be specific to your software. And not every piece of software is going to be the same. Not
every, you know, so one piece of software may use, just for instance, if you have something that uses
Azure and then you have something that uses Google, not Azure, and Google are not the same. So
you have to determine how that control is going to be a little bit different for that second application that
you're going to use it for. So, you know everything. There's no generic one size fits all ever.
[23:54] Speaker C: Linda?
[23:54] Speaker B: Oh, yes, Mahindra, you go.
[23:55] Speaker A: Oh, okay.
[23:57] Speaker C: Because yeah, like you said, you guys. Yeah, that's because I remember when I
first time brought you up, it's like integration of automation in grc. Like I brought a Venta, which, which
does have those lot of automation tools, this and that. Are you guys looking at that? When I asked you
last time, I didn't know if you. Because that was like. Because I was curious because when I started
working with you, you know, like there were a lot of spreadsheet documentation this and that. Even I
was like, maybe there could be some useful case for that. And while doing research in AI, in, you know,
AI integration, grc, that product. So are you guys also like looking into tools like Venta?
[24:31] Speaker A: I don't know if you're, you know, the person to check into Muhammad. If you're
looking into something that you would like to, that you think would benefit cgi, reach out to him. He's.
He's like on a team that does a lot of research and he's bringing in tools and then he'll bring in the ISOs
and he'll bring in a team and to listen to the vendor present the tool and then they'll make a
determination whether it's a safe, you know, safe tool, whether it's going to be client safe, because the
client would also have to approve you using that tool. So there's a lot of things involved in that. But don't
think that you found something that you find really interesting. You know, make sure you present it. You
know, even ask Shauna, because you fall under Shauna too, right? Yeah, yeah, just. She's our lead, so
ask her, hey, I've got this tool. Who can I reach out to to have them investigate it? They'll look into it and
like I said, they'll bring A team together, they'll look at the features and say, oh, this looks good. But
then they also have to take in consideration foreign countries. So if, if a company from China developed
it, then of course they're not going to use it. Yeah, if, you know, if something was developed in Iran,
they're not going to. You know, there are certain countries that we have blocked not only for our, for the
government and, but also for our company's security as well. So there's a lot of little research that they
have to do. So. Yeah, but if you definitely, if you find a tool that you think, and I think AI would really
help at least develop the implementation statement enough to where we can modify it to fit the
software. Can you hold on one second.
[26:21] Speaker C: Linda? Okay.
[26:23] Speaker B: Okay.
[26:23] Speaker C: You're back.
[26:24] Speaker A: Oh, you're back. Yeah, sorry, it was my, my name. Sorry. I told him, I'll tell him
back.
[26:31] Speaker B: No worries. Yeah, we only like a few more questions. We don't want to keep your
time. You've been really thankful with us for spending three minutes. One of the last questions I wanted
to ask was just with this sort of data part, would you say there's any sort of evidence or data you think,
like, could be captured more efficiently or, like, continuously, or if you think any sort of, like, level of
automation could be helpful and then what sort of, like, safeguards do you think would be important as
well?
[27:00] Speaker A: The. As long as there's no, I think AI, like I said, I think AI would really be helpful if
they can make sure that it's fully secured, you know, that there's no backdoor in there, or there was no
foreign country way down the line that helped develop some of the code and, you know, might have
some little back door available. But I think if, if they tied it in with what the developers are doing. So as
the developer is creating whatever it is or writing the code, if some of that could be captured in a way to
where they, they say we're going to set up this, this, this and this, then that AI tool could capture that
and use that as evidence. So as they're developing it and as they're, you know, producing it and putting
it, you know, from dev to test or whatever, and then eventually into prod. If those steps could be
captured some kind of way, I think that would really help, you know, especially capture audio evidence.
[28:03] Speaker C: Yeah, that's something actually, like you, you made the right, like, you know, the
part you were talking about capturing, and that's something that we actually have in our proposal. So
our idea is that we did not bring this up in the beginning because we just wanted to hear your insight.
So we did think about something like that is like because obviously there is that part of we can't
automate everything but something like access control where.
[28:30] Speaker B: Making.
[28:30] Speaker C: Sure that the users have least privileges because right now I'm assuming the way it
works is you would ask them hey, is this implemented? They take screenshot for you and they send it
to you. So what we thought of is like okay, as soon as that changes is made in the Google the AI
automatically captures for you unless it's send it to your document in somewhere safe instead of like so
you don't have to ask developer hey, did you implement right it automatically. Our proposal says it
automatically does it. So developers now what you would.
[29:02] Speaker A: What I would think you would need to do too is consider whatever they're doing it's
going to be related to a control. Yeah. So whatever they're doing, if it's associated with the access
control then that tool should identify. This is for AC2. This will allow AC5 or AC15A and B if those
controls could be implemented as well along with that with that capture that would really help because
then you would automatically know oh, this automatically goes here, this automatically goes here. And
that really would be beneficial. That'd be a challenge, but that would be really beneficial.
[29:48] Speaker C: Yeah, that's actually so yeah I think I told you like how in my cloud computing cloud
security class that's what we are thinking because you know, because they're like many families, you
know like even when I was working with the families I'm like you can't automate, you can't capture
everything like sort of human interaction. So we just decided to focus on like access control because
that's where Google and.
[30:10] Speaker A: The identification authentication I.A.
[30:13] Speaker C: Yeah.
[30:14] Speaker A: Your, your. There's a couple of them. Well I have to look at them too because right
off the top of my head I can't name the auditing one.
[30:22] Speaker C: I don't know if that. That can.
[30:23] Speaker A: Yeah. Au. AU should be one. Yeah. Because as soon as that, as soon as that audit
is created then it should be you know, AU whatever so or you. And even if it's assigned to the family
you can still somebody who's breaking down those. Those controls can still identify which control it
should go to. But that would really be a big help identifying evidence with the control.
[30:46] Speaker C: Yeah and the reason we thought of that is like you know the tool that I mentioned
eventa. Now let's even if worth the notam our project Were you to use that tool, you still have to get a
screenshot you as a, as a someone in Jersey, you still have. So that's what we thought. Okay, how can
we make different from the existing tool? Because like you were saying like you still need to add input.
So it's you know, what tools. So that's why we thought that capturing part would be beneficial is like. So
as soon as you met that list privileges certain it automatically captures and like actually put it in the
relevant place. But yeah so, but you know like in terms of like what do you. What are your thoughts on
like you know, this capturing tool automating all the families. Like what do you think about is that even
sort of possibility automatic? Because there are so many families that would be. I don't know what's
your thoughts on that?
[31:34] Speaker A: There, there are some, there are some companies that claim that they can look at
your system and identify elements of your system that would relate to a control. So I'm not exactly sure
how they do that. I don't know if they, I don't know exactly how they, you know, infiltrate the whole
system and be able to identify that you met this control. This control probably like for settings, for
network settings like the screensaver, if I set it for 15 minutes or if, if your account has been inactive for
45 days that it gets locked. You know, those kind of things that you can automatically see that there's
been a setting already set. Then I can see the, the that capturing that right away. But yeah, not. I don't
know that they can automate everything. It's. There's still going a lot of hands on but you know, who
knows? I mean people are working on that kind of stuff all day. You know, every day they're. They're
trying to develop what's going to make it easier for us in the compliance field.
[32:39] Speaker B: So yeah, thank you so much. I guess my final question I wanted to ask, as you
know, you've spent 35 minutes with us. We really do appreciate it for our project. I was just kind of
interested on where do you think this sort of GRC evidence collection work is? Where do you think it's
going to be within the next decade? Like how do you think this field is going to develop? What do you
think is going to happen to it? As you've been in there for a while, you've seen the development.
[33:02] Speaker A: I'm going to give you my honest opinion. In two more years I could care. I'm retiring
so I could care less what happens in the next 10 years. But I honestly do see that with the progression
of that I've seen from the time I started in the field years and years ago till now and have seen so much
that has, you know, look at. Look at what we can do on our phone. You know, who would have thought
that I could have used the phone to talk to somebody long distance? You know, I mean, so everything
that happened that's happened from that time to this time. It's possible. Yeah, it's possible that you
could have the majority of it automated, but then you still have to make sure that that system that you
doing the automating is still a secure system. Yeah. So even even if you build a system, it still has to go
through all those check marks. It still has to go through all those controls and make sure that it's still,
you know, a safe system to use. Yeah. But, yeah, I see it. I see it could be. It's a possibility. So. So did
you see my pool?
[34:10] Speaker B: It looks lovely. Wow.
[34:11] Speaker C: Yeah, it's a high school.
[34:13] Speaker A: Yeah. This is where I come every night. I just come out here and sit and listen to
the water and enjoy the weather and.
[34:19] Speaker B: Yeah, it's beautiful. What state are you in?
[34:21] Speaker A: I'm in Georgia.
[34:22] Speaker B: Georgia?
[34:23] Speaker A: Yeah. I'm in about 12 miles out of Atlanta.
[34:26] Speaker B: Oh, wow. It looks lovely there. Yeah. I wish we had a pool behind us.
[34:31] Speaker A: Well, I bought the pool and the house kind of sort of came with it.
[34:35] Speaker B: Well, yes. Thank you again, Linda, for your time. It really helped our team. We're
going to use a lot of information to help, you know, when we're thinking about building our product, how
we want to, you know, talk about this information. So, yeah, just. Thank you again. We were maybe just
wondering if in the future, if me and Mahendra, me and our team, we're going to continue hopefully
building this product out, putting more thought into it if we could ever possibly, like, meet up again and,
you know, get some input on it. Just your thoughts, because obviously you're someone who's very well
experienced in this field compared to me, who has, like, no experience. And, you know, Mahendra
obviously has a little. But it's very valuable insight. Thank you again.
[35:09] Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know. I don't know how much I helped, but this was
easier than I thought it was going to be.
[35:15] Speaker B: But you were super helpful, like, for someone like me, like, who I hadn't been.
Basically no understanding of the GRC space. Besides, some of Google searches, like, you really did
explain it really well to me how like, everything works out. How the hierarchy is, the issues, possible,
you know, opportunities. So. Yeah, thank you.
[35:33] Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. And like I said, you just have to. We just had. We had to be really
careful that we didn't discuss a whole lot of what we're actually doing at work. So I tried to, you know,
make it generalized. So whatever I. Whatever I said, that's perfect.
[35:46] Speaker B: Yeah.
[35:46] Speaker A: I hope it helped.
[35:47] Speaker B: Yeah.
[35:48] Speaker C: Thank you. Thank you, Linda. So much explanation. Like I said, some of our team
members are new to grc, so you. Because I was trying to explain to them, and I couldn't really explain
properly, but you've been actually explaining everything, and hopefully they'll see this video and, like,
you know, they'll better understand now, like, oh, this is what's needed, and this is. Okay, so now you
made it more clear. Because I tried my best, you know, as an intern. I tried, but you actually hearing it
from me, I think it will help them understand.
[36:12] Speaker A: So what I. So what I explained was.
[36:14] Speaker C: Yeah, it was very big.
[36:15] Speaker B: It was great.
[36:16] Speaker C: Yeah, it's very beneficial.
[36:17] Speaker A: Okay. Okay, great. Okay, great. All right, well, thank you, guys.
[36:21] Speaker B: Well, thank you so much. You want to stay back for one second? Thank you so
much. Take care.
[36:26] Speaker A: All right. All right.
[36:30] Speaker B: Cool. Do you. I think you're the one actually recording. I don't think.
[36:33] Speaker C: Yeah, I. I have recording. Should I stop it?
[36:35] Speaker B: Yeah, you can stop the recording. Yeah. Okay
